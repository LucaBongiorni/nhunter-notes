*Initial Notes*
I have Kali Nethunter on Nexus 5 that is on Lollipop.  For more info go to the Kali Linux Nethunter downloads page https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/

The following are my general notes about Nexus 5 on Nethunter, mainly around the tools, set up, etc.  So far I've looked at the list of tools on http://tools.kali.org/tools-listing.
